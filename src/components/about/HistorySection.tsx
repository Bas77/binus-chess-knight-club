          BINUS Chess Club was established in 2024 by a small group of
          passionate chess players who wanted to create a community for
          students to learn, practice, and compete in chess.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Over the years, we've grown from a handful of members to one
          of the most active student organizations at Bina Nusantara
          University, hosting regular tournaments, workshops, and social
          events.

          Our club has represented BINUS in various inter-university and
          public chess competitions.
